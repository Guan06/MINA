# MINA

An increasing number of microbiome datasets are generating with the help of
rapidly developing sequencing technologies. Currently, analysis of taxonomic
profiling data is mainly conducted using composition-based methods, which
ignores the interactions between community members and limits the study of
community dynamics. The goal of MINA (**M**icrobial d**I**versity and
**N**etwork **A**nalysis) is to provide a framework for microbial community
analysis based on network structures with statistical tests.
