\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class `mina` with @norm and @des defined.}

\item{group}{The column name of descriptive file @des for comparison.}

\item{g_size}{The cutoff of group size used for filtering, default is 88.}

\item{s_size}{The number of samples used for network inference during
bootstrap and permutation (when `sig` is TRUE), it should be smaller than
g_size / 2 to make sure the randomness; default is 30.}

\item{rm}{Filtering the components present in less than `per` of the samples
from compared groups, default TRUE.}

\item{per}{The percentage of present samples for filtering, default is 0.1.}

\item{sig}{Whether to test the significance, skip the permutation when set as
FALSE, default is TRUE.}

\item{bs}{The times for bootstrap network inference, default is 6.}

\item{pm}{The times for permuatated samples network inference, default is 6.}

\item{individual}{Whether to output the bootstrap and permutation results of
each comparison individually, default is FALSE.}

\item{out_dir}{The output directory if `individual` is TRUE, default is the
current working directory}
}
\value{
x The same object with @multi and @perm defined.
